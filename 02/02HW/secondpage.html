    <strong><em>Pembrokes</em></strong> have an average life expectancy of 12â€“15 years. Health problems may include degenerative myelopathy, hip dysplasia, and Von Willebrand's disease if their parents suffered from the same problems. Pembrokes descend from the line that is the northern spitz-type dog (examples include that of the Siberian Husky).
