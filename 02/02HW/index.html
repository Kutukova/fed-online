    Corgi
  </h1>
  <p>
    <strong>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi</strong> <em>(Welsh for "dwarf dog")</em>, is a herding dog breed, which originated in Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is one of two breeds known as Welsh Corgi: the other is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is the younger of the two Corgi breeds and is a separate and distinct breed from the Cardigan. This breed is also a mix of the Canterbury Welsh Corgi. The corgi is one of the smallest dogs in the Herding Group. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are famed for being the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who has owned more than 30 during her reign. These dogs have been favored by British royalty for more than seventy years.

  <h2>
    Appearance
  </h2>
  <p>
    <strong><em>The Corgi</em></strong> is proportional to larger breeds but has shorter legs, yet has a sturdy appearance and an athletic body that helps it herd livestock such as poultry, sheep and cattle. Its body is long, and it has a naturally long, bobbed, or artificially docked tail and erect, big ears. The corgi's head should be foxy in shape and appearance. The Corgi differs from the closely related Cardigan Welsh Corgi by being shorter in length and having straighter legs.

  <h3>
    Coat and color
  </h3>
  <p>
<em>There are five "allowed" colors for Pembroke Welsh Corgis:</em>
<br>
<strong><em>Red:</em></strong> with or without white markings, which may appear on the feet and legs, muzzle, between the eyes and over the head as a small blaze, and around the neck as a full or partial collar. Red is the most commonly seen color as it is the genetically most dominant of the colors.
<br>
<strong><em>Sable with white markings:</em></strong> similar to red, with a light peppering of black.
<br>
<strong><em>Fawn with white markings:</em></strong> similar to above, but a lighter red (the red can be from a light brown to a deep red)
<br>
<strong><em>Red-headed tricolor:</em></strong> a black dog with a red head, red spots above the eyes, on the sides of the muzzle, on the legs, in the ears and around the tail area. White markings as described above may also be present; the white markings can often obscure some of the red markings of the muzzle and legs. A dog would be considered a "mismark" if black and white with no tan present.
<br>
<strong><em>Black-headed tricolor (the most recessive color genetically):</em></strong> black and red, with red and white markings as described under "Red" above. A dog would be considered a "mismark" if black and white with no tan present.

    Temperament
  </h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Pembroke Welsh Corgis</strong> are very affectionate, love to be involved in the family, and tend to follow wherever their owners go. They have a great desire to please their owners, thus making them eager to learn and train. The dogs are easy to train and are ranked as the eleventh smartest dog in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs. Besides herding, they also function as watchdogs due to their alertness and tendency to bark only as needed. Most Pembrokes will seek the attention of everyone they meet and behave well around children and other pets. It is important to socialise this breed with other animals, adults and children when they are very young to avoid any anti-social behavior or aggression later in life. Due to their herding instinct, they love to chase anything that moves, so it is best to keep them inside fenced areas. <em>The herding instinct will also cause some younger Pembrokes to nip at their owner's ankles.</em>

    History
  </h2>
  <p>
    <strong><em>The Pembroke Welsh Corgi</em></strong> lineage has been traced back as far as 1107 AD. It is said that the Vikings and Flemish weavers brought the dogs with them as they traveled to reside in Wales.As far back as the 10th century, Corgis were herding sheep, geese, ducks, horses and cattle as one of the oldest herding breed of dogs. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are closely related to Schipperkes, Keeshonds, Pomeranians, Samoyeds, Chow Chows, Norwegian Elkhounds and Finnish Spitz. <strong>Pembrokes and Cardigans</strong> first appeared together in 1925 when they were shown under the rules of The Kennel Club in Britain. The Corgi Club was founded in December, 1925 in Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire. It is reported that the local members favored the Pembroke breed, so a club for Cardigan enthusiasts was founded a year or so later.> Both groups have worked hard to ensure the appearance and type of breed are standardized through careful selective breeding. <strong>Pembrokes and Cardigans</strong> were officially recognized by the Kennel Club in 1928 and were initially categorized together under the single heading of Welsh Corgis, before the two breeds were recognized as separate and distinct in 1934. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are becoming more popular in the United States and rank 24th in American Kennel Club registrations, as of 2012.
